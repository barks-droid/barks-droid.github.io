        <h3>Intake system for 2024-2025 game "Into the Deep"</h3>
        <p>Our team decided on using an active intake system to pick up "samples" (3x1.5x1.5 rectangular prisms) from the center of the field quickly and efficiently. My design, which we implemented at the qualifiers, features TPU bootkicker wheels to intake the samples into the bucket, and an outer attachment to position the sample in the correct orientation for the outtake system.</p>

        <h3>Outtake claw for our first design (2024-25)</h3>
        <p>I designed the claws to be very long (they were nicknamed the "chopsticks") so that our bot could either transition samples from the intake system into the baskets (high containers which samples could be placed in for points) or reach over teh front of the bot to pick of "specimens" (samples with a clip attached to them that were worth more points) from the human player easily</p>

        <h3>Match showcasing our basket scoring ability (video 1)</h3>
        <p>In this match our teamate was only able to score specimens, while we were able to do either. because of this, we ran our specimen autonomus at the start then transitioned over to scoring in the baskets. We had not coded in specific positions for the outtake claw and intake bucket to line up, so it required manual input which lowered its efficiency. It still functioned relatively well in the competition.</p>
  
        <h3>Match showcasing our specimen scoring ability (video 2)</h3>
        <p>In this match our teamate was only able to score samples in the baskets, so we took over the specimen scoring. Our robot was more optomized for specimen scoring, and this match showed how we were able to score multiple specimens.</p>
   
        <h3>State meet failure (video 3)</h3>
        <p>After seeing great success in the qualifying match, one of our team mentors (who is no longer a major contributor to our team) wanted us to redesign and rebuild the entire robot within the month we had between competitions. We may have been able to do this, but there was some division amongst the team on how we should redesign, leading to differing cocepts and a rushed bot. In the end we used two simple clawd which I designed for the intake and out-take as well as a large rotating arm attached to the front linear slide to reach into the center "submersible". The out-take claw was attached to two linear slides which we connected together, though it was hard to get them synced properly. Because of the multitude of flaws in the rushed clunky robot, we had issues with our intake system and more majorly with the vertical linear slides, as one kept getting jammed. Eventually the mentor which told us to redesign took the robot in his lap and pried the linear slide apart to "unjam it." bearings flew everywhere and our state meet was officially over. We were ranked as one of the top seeds in the state going in, but left as the sixteenth. This to me was a good lesson about what succesful leadership should and should not look like, and revealed some of the consequences that come with impulsive redesigns</p>

        <h3>New chassis Concept</h3>
        <p>Designed with ten TPU forks on the front to act a little more as a control bot, while having two long aluminum forks which will replace the thin front plate in the old design. The new model will also be using a G10 baseplate and top plate, and UHMW side panels. The wheels will also be more cleet-like for even better traction in the soft wood at NHRL.</p>

        <h3>Original Concept</h3>
        <p>Features a pretty compact main chassis, where the weapon was mounted inside. This was redesigned into the version which competed in November, taking the spinner outside of the chassis and lowering the design to the ground</p>

        <h3>Low Power Functionality Test</h3>
        <p>This is a brief clip from part of the functionality testing for Fred. Through testing I found that lower power on the weapon led to more of a flipping type of hit, while higher speeds led to a more saw-like cutting hit. In this example the forks and front plate work excellent against the stationary ~2.5 lb piece of wood which it was tested against, flipping it into the air and removing a chunk.</p>

        <h3>Our Side by Side Picture Between Fred and dimachaerus</h3>
        <p>Our bot looks way less refined in comparison to the bot which had competed seven times before. I sometimes wonder if we would have stood more of a chance against another less experienced bot. We were thrown to the wolves in our first fight, and our more rudementary design and driving made it much harder to compete. For the newer design I am working on refining Fred's geometry and strategy to stand more of a chance</p>
