        <h3>Intake system for 2024-2025 game "Into the Deep"</h3>
        <p>Our team decided on using an active intake system to pick up "samples" (3x1.5x1.5 rectangular prisms) from the center of the field quickly and efficiently. My design, which we implemented at the qualifiers, features TPU bootkicker wheels to intake the samples into the bucket, and an outer attachment to position the sample in the correct orientation for the outtake system.</p>

        <h3>Outtake claw for our first design (2024-25)</h3>
        <p>I designed the claws to be very long (they were nicknamed the "chopsticks") so that our bot could either transition samples from the intake system into the baskets (high containers which samples could be placed in for points) or reach over the front of the bot to pick up "specimens" (samples with a clip attached to them that were worth more points) from the human player easily</p>

        <h3>Match showcasing our basket scoring ability (video 1)</h3>
        <p>In this match our teamate was only able to score specimens, while we were able to do either. because of this, we ran our specimen autonomus at the start then transitioned over to scoring in the baskets. We had not coded in specific positions for the outtake claw and intake bucket to line up, so it required manual input which lowered its efficiency. It still functioned relatively well in the competition.</p>
  
        <h3>Match showcasing our specimen scoring ability (video 2)</h3>
        <p>In this match our teamate was only able to score samples in the baskets, so we took over the specimen scoring. Our robot was more optomized for specimen scoring, and this match showed how we were able to score multiple specimens.</p>
   
        <h3>State meet failure (video 3)</h3>
        <p>After seeing great success in the qualifying match, one of our team mentors (who is no longer a major contributor to our team) wanted us to redesign and rebuild the entire robot within the month we had between competitions. We may have been able to do this, but there was some division amongst the team on how we should redesign, leading to differing cocepts and a rushed bot. In the end we used two simple claws which I designed for the intake and out-take as well as a large rotating arm attached to the front linear slide to reach into the center "submersible". The out-take claw was attached to two linear slides which we connected together, though it was hard to get them synced properly. Because of the multitude of flaws in the rushed design, we had issues with our intake system and more severely with the vertical linear slides, as one kept getting jammed. This to me was a good lesson about what succesful leadership should and should not look like, and revealed some of the consequences that come with impulsive redesigns</p>

        <h3>Launcher prototype 2025-26</h3>
        <p>This year the game is focused on shooting colored balls into a basket. This launcher is the outtake system for our robot, and features a long back ramp formed around a 72mm Gecko Wheel from Gobilda (not visible in file) as well as a hooded top which can be used to change the launch angles. Through testing we realized that the launch wheels slowed considerably between balls, and in order to maximize the speed at which we could score we needed to increase the rotational momentum of the system. We did this by adding about 600 grams of weight to the axle, increasing the moment of inertia and allowing us to fire three balls consecutively with minimal loss in speed. We are excited to see how this concept works at the qualifier on December 13th.</p>

         <h3>Qualifyer Dec 13th</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, due to the tragedy which occured at Brown University on the day of the competition accross the street from the qualifier, the livestreams were taken down and the competition left unfinished. Our bot, which we had gone in with the expectation we were going to be a mid-ladder team, was ranked as the first seed for the majority of the competition, until our teamates recieved a major foul in our last match, pushing us down to sixth before the playoffs.  Our bot's cycle time was much faster than our opponents, and we were able to score reliably and consistently throughout the tele-op period. We are going to optimize our speed based system by adding a turret which will auto-lock on the goal so we do not have to manually aim. </p>
