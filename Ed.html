        <h3>Edward</h3>
        <p>This is a showcase of the response of "Edward," my small desktop AI assistant robot. The spherical head can tilt and rotate through the rotation of three servo motors, with various idle animations and emotional responses to prompts. Because this was an information-based question, Edward uses a curious head tilt when responding, but he is also able to convey boredom, tiredness, excitement, anger, and yes/no animations. Edward utilizes APIs from Deepgram, OpenAI, and Google TTS to facilitate speech-to-speech conversations. He was given a cheery personality with a British accent, making his responses feel warm and friendly.</p>

        <h3>Edward Movement Showcase</h3>
        <p>This is a showcase of a few of the idle movements of Edward. Idle movements move Edward's head to a random position. I decreased the time in between idle animations for this video, but they normally range from 30-120 seconds after the previous animation.</p>

        <h3>Fully Assembled Circuit board for Edward</h3>
        <p>This is the fully assembled circuit board that houses the modules that run Edward. It uses an ESP32-WROOM microcontroller, an SD card reader module, a MAX98357A I2S amplifier, and a MAX4466 electret microphone module to receive and output audio. Three servos, two LEDs, and a button are connected by wires to the board. It all started as a simple breadboard prototype before I transferred it over to a more permanent housing.</p>

        <h3>Tilting Mechanism</h3>
        <p>This is the mechanical structure of "Edward." The three servo motors offer 3 degrees of freedom. The mechanism that drives the head tilt and rotation is inspired by the design of a joystick, where the x-axis and y-axis tilt to tilt the head at a certain angle. The servo in the center can then rotate to spin the head. </p>
