          <p>Fred is a compact competition robot focused on delivering high kinetic energy impacts to the underbellies of opponents. The design emphasizes energy transfer efficiency, affordability, and aggressive strategy. The affordablity aspect of the design called for more 3D printed parts than what is probably healthy for a combat robot, and our bot wasn't able to withstand hits as well as others and is currently being redesigned with more durable materials.</p>
          <h3>Performance Highlights</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Peak spin speed: ~6,800 RPM (calculated)</li>
            <li>Approx. 3 lb (weight-legal)</li>
            <li> 1 lb weapon system delivering ~125 J of kinetic energy (calculated)</li>
            <li>Almost entirely 3D printed on an Ender 3; total cost about $300–350</li>

          <h3>What worked at the competition</h3>
          <ul>
            <p> Even though we didn't have much of an opportunity to actually compete and test our bot, given that we only had one match, there were a few parts of our bot which worked well.</p>
            <li>Firstly, the ground control of our bot (in testing) was exceptional. While most bots face manuverability issues due to the gyroscopic forces of their weapon, Fred remained reliably manuverable. I believe this is due to the wide drivetrain and the fact that the robot always had four wheels on the ground instead of two.</li>
             <li>Secondly, the weapon system had a very quick spin up time, letting it get up to speed in little time. Additionally, the weapon system did not make a lot of noise, meaning less energy was being lost to vibrations and noise</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>What needs improvement</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>If you view the full video of our first ever battle, you will notice how Fred's front plate gets split upwards after one hit. It is made out of a cheap and lightweight aluminum sheet, and while the sheet stood up in testing it was not strong enough in application. I couldn't have safely tested its strength against an opposing flywheel, but now I know it was much to thin and not secure.</li>
            <li>As mentioned, the drivetrain stopped working fully during our first match. While we might have been able to get a good hit or two in, especially in the advantage state we had with our opponent upside down, the drivetrain was not working at full power. It struggled to get under and push our opponent, though in testing it was easily able to push more than three pounds. Admittidly, this was partly due to human error, as I had never been in one of these matches before, but I also think one of the motor axles slipped out of the wheel. In the future a new wheel mounting connector will be implemented to prevent this from happening. </li>
            <li>The chassis, which was almost entirely 3D printed because of funding, stood up to one or two hits, but crumpled on one side after being hit by a few more. The crumple zones and pockets did technically work, isolating the impacts to one side and leaving the other one essentially untouched, but the plastic pieces could not take much of a beating and will need to be switched out to make a more competetive bot.  </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Future implementations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>After getting a good view of what did and did not work, there were a few realizations that our team made. One was that our bot will have to be made out of stronger materials, notably UHMW and G10 plates. The overall structure of the bot must also be changed to not be so reliant on a thin aluminum plate.</li>
            <li>As for the main bot that we are going to register, it wil be the same concept as Fred, except instead of a flat front plate it will have two long potruding aluminum forks that act as a ramp, with the weapon mounted in between them. The forks would have TPU on the outer sides of them to help control opponents as well as protect them from being ripped out of the chassis. Additionally, the design will be more centered around an assembly of flat platesrather than the more complex assembly we brought with us in November. This will make the bot more durable and more simple to fix. We will also be utilizing a new cnc machine at our school to switch 3D pinted parts out for carbon fiber and UHMW sheets. Early CAD iterations of this design are already being developed, and a picture is included in the full gallery</li>

          <h3 style="margin-top:14px">About Competition:</h3>
          <p style="color:var(--muted); margin:0;">The day before the competition, our team passed safety inspection with no issues. The bot performed exactly as intended, showing excellent ground control, speed, and striking power. This was however, only true until about halfway through our first match, when the drivetrain stopped operating at its full capacity. This, in addition to my comparitively lower driving experieince, eliminated Fred's advantage and made it difficult to maneuver effectively or deliver clean hits. The chassis, which had been designed to isolate single impacts, began to shatter piece by piece under repeated strikes. After we tapped out of the match, the cage lights failed to activate, and our opponent delivered an additional hit that tore apart the entire right side of the robot, leaving it beyond simple repair. We had only an hour to rebuild before our next match. The repair session quickly became a coordinated rush as I assigned tasks and tried to keep progress steady. Our drill failed midway through, preventing us from installing two critical screws, but we still managed to restore functionality. The rebuilt version wasn’t elegant- one side was missing, and the receiver was secured to the top of the frame with electrical tape- but the drivetrain, though slightly misaligned, was actually performing better than it was in the first match. Unfortunately, just before the next round, we discovered that the signal wire to the weapon motor had been stripped loose during repairs, forcing us to forfeit the match. We're coming back stronger than ever in April</p>
